# 2. ACTIONS_STORAGE: Use 'GITHUB_OUTPUT' for cross-step variables.
# 3. WORKFLOW_PERSISTENCE: Use 'git commit' to maintain memory in index.html.
# 4. GITHUB_PAGES: Serving is asynchronous; wait 60s for manifest.
# 5. SECRETS_MANAGEMENT: Only access via os.getenv(). Never print tokens.
# 6. SURVIVAL_LOGIC: Monitor Action Minutes in billing/gh-actions.
